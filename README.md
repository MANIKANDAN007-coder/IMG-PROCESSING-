1. Euclidean Transformations
  Operations: Rotation + Translation
Preserves shape and size (rigid body motion).
Represented by a rotation matrix + translation vector.
Demo: A square rotated and shifted.

2.Similarity Transformations

Operations: Rotation + Translation + Uniform Scaling
Preserves shape, but not size.
Special case of affine transform with scaling factor k.
Demo: A square rotated, shifted, and uniformly scaled
